### Name
nm-comp-challenge

### Description
Following formatting of a static comp given to us, I created a basic HTML website, that past responding to the size of the window, doesn't have any actual functionality. This project is looking to just explore HTML and CSS basics to replicate a mock up given to us by a "designer".

### Visuals

### Support

### Roadmap
First and foremost, the responsiveness of this site leaves much to be desired. And that is where work could easily be put in next. While the mobile display is somewhat attractive, it's not intuitive at all. And while the site performs alright at a variety of window sizes, it by no means performs well in all. 
As far as actual implementation: this is a webformat that could actually be helpful for drag families, or compiling contact information/simple info on a group of performers, which would require actual javascript functionality. Also this project could be used in the future for farther expanding upon fundamentals, as it already has grids and other HTML/CSS elements built out for experimentation.

### Project status
Currently this project is "finished", but may have more time poured into it in the future. Given limited prior knowledge and lack of experience we feel it's a great representation of early work, with lots of room for improvement.
